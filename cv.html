Another of Chrysas' qualities is her attention to detail and flair for design. She is constantly striving to improve her skills and whatever she is working on. I would never hesitate working with Chrysa again and highly recommend her to anyone considering hiring her.

                            I remember a particular moment where I was stuck implementing this tricky bit of CSS and JS. Chrysa herself was very busy at the time, but took time out to help me workout the details in the feature. On top of that she would ping me every so often to check if I needed further assistance. In summary Chrysa is a fantastic team player and excellent front-end developer."
